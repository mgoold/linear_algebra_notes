## Problems

### USF

1. Though we can think of both as an N-tuple of real values (in other words an ordered list of N-many continuous real numbers), what is the fundamental difference between a point and a vector? 

2. The __________is a special vector. It stays the same vector no matter what we scale it by. If we add or subtract to another vector $\overrightarrow{v}$ , the resulting vector is $\overrightarrow{v}$. 

3. True or False: If one scales a vector by a non-zero value, the resulting vector will lie along the same line. 

### Strang

Under what conditions on a, b, c, d is 

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
c \\ 
d \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

a multiple m of

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
a \\ 
b \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

?   Start with the two equations c = ma and d = mb. By eliminating m, find one equation connecting a,b,c,d. You can assume no zeros in these numbers.

2.  Going around a triangle from (0, 0) to (5.0) to (0, 12) to (0, 0), what are those three vectors u, v, w? What is u + v + w? What are their lengths ||u|| and ||v|| and ||w||?
    The length squared of a vector $\large{u\text{ = }\left(u_1,u_2\right)\text{ is }{\|\|u\|\|}^2\text{ = }u_1^2 + u_2^2}$ .

3.  Descnbe geometrically (line, plane, or all of R3) all linear combinations of

$$
\text{(a)  }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 \\ 
2 \\  
3 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
3 \\ 
6 \\  
9 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{,  (b)  }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 \\ 
0 \\  
0 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 \\ 
2 \\  
3 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{,  (c)  }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 \\ 
0 \\  
0 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 \\ 
2 \\  
2 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 \\ 
2 \\  
3 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

.

4.  Draw

$$
\text{v = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
4 \\ 
1 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and w = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-2 \\ 
2 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

and v+w and v-w in a single plane.

5.  If

$$
\text{v + w = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
5 \\ 
1 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and v - w = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 \\ 
5 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

, commpute and draw the vectors v and w.

6.  From

$$
\text{v = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 \\ 
1 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ and w = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 \\ 
2 \\  
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

, find the components of 3v + w and cv + dw .

7.  Compute u + v + w and 2u + 2v + w. How do you know u, v, w lie in a plane?

Follow-up:  These lie in a plance because w = cu + dv.  Find c and d:

$$
\text{u = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
1 \\
2 \\
3 \\
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ v = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
-3 \\
1 \\
-2 \\
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ w = }
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 \\
-3 \\
-1 \\
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

.

8.  Every combination of v = (1,-2,1) and w = (0, 1, —1) has components that add to ____________. Find c and d so that cv + dw = (3,3, —6). Why is (3, 3, 6) impossible?

9.  In the xy plane mark all nine of these linear combinations:

$$
\text{c}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
2 \\
1 \\
\end{array} 
\right]
\text{ + d}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
0 \\
1 \\
\end{array} 
\right]
$$

... with c = 0,1,2 and d = 0,1,2 .

10.  (Not easy) How could you decide if the vectors u = (1,1,0) and v = (0,1, 1) and  w = (a, b, c) are linearly independent or dependent ?
