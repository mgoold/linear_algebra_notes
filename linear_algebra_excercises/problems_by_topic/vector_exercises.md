## Problems

1. Though we can think of both as an N-tuple of real values (in other words an ordered list of N-many continuous real numbers), what is the fundamental difference between a point and a vector? 

2. The __________is a special vector. It stays the same vector no matter what we scale it by. If we add or subtract to another vector $\overrightarrow{v}$ , the resulting vector is $\overrightarrow{v}$. 

3. True or False: If one scales a vector by a non-zero value, the resulting vector will lie along the same line.
