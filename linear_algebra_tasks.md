# Linear Algebra Tasks

The purpose of this do is to index all the tasks/algorithms I've had to do while learning linear algebra.  I find it difficult to organize this kind of content in my head, so I'm trying to recuded it down to task: solution pairs, e.g, "find inverse of matrix -- > do GJ elimination on an AI:I-A format" .  In doing so, I'm collating tasks from USF's MSDS course, and MIT 18.06.  At the start, I'm prioritizing and distinguising tasks, so not every task will have a solution.   As always, feel free to reach out with corrects &c.
