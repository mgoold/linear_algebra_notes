# Linear Algebra Related Calculus

* The following content itemizes calculus concepts I've had to learn in the context of learning linear algebra.
* Sometimes it will duplicate other content in this repo.  As you'd expect, most of it has to do with calculus, especially derivatives. 
* There is though some content on trig, which I found stultifying in high school but now find contextually interesting for the first time.
