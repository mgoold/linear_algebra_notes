# linear_algebra_notes

These are my notes-to-self on linear algebra concepts and lectures, almost all related to [MIT 18.06 content](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) .  I've had to be quite detailed in order to have any hope of understanding this a year (or more) from now, so it may be useful to you as well.  

The conceptual content is ordered serially across the "linear_algebra_content_" files.  There is a folder of excercises from MIT 18.06.  The "linear algebra tasks" file tries to index common problems and solution algorithms.

By all means reach out with corrections as you encounter inevitable mistakes in understanding, markdown code, etc.

I will continue to add content as I learn, but anticipate quitting (with regrets) after determinants and eigenvectors because of time constraints.
