# linear_algebra_notes

These are my notes-to-self on linear algebra concepts and lectures, almost related to [MIT 18.06 content](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) .  I've had to be quite detailed in order to have any hope of understanding this a year (or moe) from now, so it may be useful to you as well.  

By all means reach out with corrections as you encounter inevitable mistakes in understanding, markdown code, etc.
