# linear_algebra_notes

These are my notes-to-self on linear algebra concepts and lectures, almost all related to [MIT 18.06 content](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) .  I've had to be quite detailed in order to have any hope of understanding this a year (or more) from now, so it may be useful to you as well.  

The conceptual content is ordered serially across the "linear_algebra_content_" files, more or less following the order of the 18.06 course.

Note that, as this repo developed, the "Strang" source content ended up coming from several editions (4th, 5th, 6th), reflecting what I could find online.

The most helpful thing may be the "cheat_sheet.md" , which has the most succinct notes in preparation for tests.  As of this writing, there isn't a way to view markdown code on your phone -- so you may want to download this page (with the markdown rendered) as a pdf and then upload it to your phone for viewing.  
There's also a "matrix generation.ipynb" jupyter file for generating matrices to test yourself.  At the top I've stored matrices that are more human-friendly for testing.
