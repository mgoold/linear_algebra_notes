# linear_algebra_notes

These are my notes-to-self on linear algebra concepts and lectures, almost all related to [MIT 18.06 content](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) .  I've had to be quite detailed in order to have any hope of understanding this a year (or more) from now, so it may be useful to you as well.  

The conceptual content is ordered serially across the "linear_algebra_content_" files, more or less following the order of the 18.06 course.

Note that, as this repo developed, the "Strang" source content ended up coming from several editions (4th, 5th, 6th), reflecting what I could find online..

There is a folder of excercises, one directory for Strang/MIT 18.06, and one organized by object type (function, vector, matrix).  I may never get it completely organized, but I believe the best testing process for this topic would be one that that allows you to do all the exercises on a complete bestiary of vector and matrix types, since each type carries its own challenges.

I will continue to add content as I learn, but anticipate quitting (with regrets) after determinants and eigenvectors because of time constraints.

To Do:
* ITLA 5th Edition, ch 3.1. "Vector Spaces" --extremely poor match between the problem set and the textbook content and corresponding online lecture.  Need to find better source to understand this content.
