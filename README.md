# linear_algebra_notes

These are my notes-to-self on linear algebra concepts and lectures, almost all related to [MIT 18.06 content](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) .  I've had to be quite detailed in order to have any hope of understanding this a year (or more) from now, so it may be useful to you as well.  

The conceptual content is ordered serially across the "linear_algebra_content_" files, more or less following the order of the 18.06 course.

Note that, as this repo developed, most of the "Strang" source content noted in the "linear_algebra_content_" files are from his "Intro to Linear Algebra" 4th edition.  However, the problem set content is from the 6th edition, as that is the edition for which I could find the solutions manual.  Still, the pagination from either source should land you in a likely spot in the books.

There is a folder of excercises, one directory for Strang/MIT 18.06, and one organized by topic.  The topical organization aims to prepare for the USF linear algebra entrance exam.

The "linear algebra tasks" file tries to index common problems and solution algorithms.

By all means reach out with corrections as you encounter inevitable mistakes in understanding, markdown code, etc.

I will continue to add content as I learn, but anticipate quitting (with regrets) after determinants and eigenvectors because of time constraints.
